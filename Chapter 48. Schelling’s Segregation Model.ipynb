    "In 1969, Thomas C. Schelling developed a simple but striking model of [racial segregation](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2008/RM6014.pdf). In particular, it shows that relatively mild preference for neighbors of similar race can lead in aggregate to the collapse of mixed neighborhoods, and high levels of segregation.\n",

    "#### Set-up\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose we have two types of people: orange people and green people. we will assume there are 250 of each type.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These agents all live on a single unit square. The location of an agent is just a point $(ùë•,ùë¶)$, where $0 < ùë•,ùë¶ < 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preferences\n",
    "* We will say that an agent is happy if half or more of her 10 nearest neighbors are of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An important point here is that agents are not averse to living in mixed areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Behaviour\n",
    "* Initially, agents are mixed together (integrated). In particular, the initial location of each agent is an independent draw from a bivariate uniform distribution on $ùëÜ = (0, 1)^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We assume that each agent will stay put if they are happy and move if unhappy. The algorithm for moving is as follows:\n",
    "    1. Draw a random location in $ùëÜ$;\n",
    "    2. If happy at new location, move there; \n",
    "    3. Else, go to step 1."
